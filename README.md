PRD: Handwritten Digit Recognition Using CNN (MNIST)
1. Overview
Develop a robust, production-ready system that classifies handwritten digits (0-9) from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model will be trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, serving as a benchmark for computer vision and deep learning skills.

2. Dataset Information
Dataset: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)

Source: MNIST official site

Content: 70,000 grayscale images (60,000 training, 10,000 testing)

Image Size: 28x28 pixels

Classes: 10 (digits 0-9)

Format: Each image is labeled and normalized, suitable for supervised classification tasks.

3. Libraries & Tools
Python 3.x

TensorFlow and Keras (for model building and training)

NumPy (data manipulation)

Matplotlib (visualization)

scikit-learn (metrics, cross-validation)

Jupyter Notebook (development environment)

4. Functional Requirements
Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset

Build a CNN architecture optimized for digit classification

Train and validate the model using the training and test sets

Achieve at least 98.5% accuracy on the test set

Provide a REST API endpoint for real-time digit prediction

Visualize model predictions and feature maps

Document the code and provide a clear README

5. Implementation Tasks
Project Setup

Initialize GitHub repository and environment

Install required libraries

Data Handling

Download and load MNIST dataset

Normalize and reshape images for CNN input

Split data into training, validation, and test sets

Model Development

Design and implement the CNN architecture

Compile the model with appropriate optimizer and loss function

Add data augmentation (rotation, shifting)

Training & Validation

Train the model with early stopping and checkpointing

Evaluate on validation and test sets

Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance

Prediction & Visualization

Implement prediction function for single and batch images

Visualize predictions and misclassifications

Use Grad-CAM or similar for feature map visualization

Deployment

Build a REST API endpoint for inference (Flask or FastAPI)

Prepare Dockerfile for containerized deployment

Documentation

Write detailed README with setup, usage, and results

Add code comments and docstrings

Provide sample input/output examples

Testing

Write unit and integration tests

Test with custom images outside the MNIST dataset

# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using CNN (MNIST)
## 1. Overview
  Develop a robust, production-ready system that classifies handwritten digits (0-9) from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model will be trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, serving as a   benchmark for computer vision and deep learning skills.

## 2. Dataset Information
* Dataset: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)

* Source: MNIST official site

* Content: 70,000 grayscale images (60,000 training, 10,000 testing)

* Image Size: 28x28 pixels

* Classes: 10 (digits 0-9)

* Format: Each image is labeled and normalized, suitable for supervised classification tasks.

## 3. Libraries & Tools
* Python 3.x

* TensorFlow and Keras (for model building and training)

* NumPy (data manipulation)

* Matplotlib (visualization)

* scikit-learn (metrics, cross-validation)

* Jupyter Notebook (development environment)

## 4. Functional Requirements
* Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset

* Build a CNN architecture optimized for digit classification

* Train and validate the model using the training and test sets

* Achieve at least 98.5% accuracy on the test set

* Provide a REST API endpoint for real-time digit prediction

* Visualize model predictions and feature maps

* Document the code and provide a clear README

## 5. Implementation Tasks
<b>1. Project Setup</b>
  * Initialize GitHub repository and environment
    
  * Install required libraries
 

<b>2. Data Handling</b>

* Download and load MNIST dataset

* Normalize and reshape images for CNN input

* Split data into training, validation, and test sets

<b>3. Model Development</b>

* Design and implement the CNN architecture

* Compile the model with appropriate optimizer and loss function

* Add data augmentation (rotation, shifting)

<b>4. Training & Validation</b>

* Train the model with early stopping and checkpointing

* Evaluate on validation and test sets

* Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance

<b>5. Prediction & Visualization</b>

* Implement prediction function for single and batch images

* Visualize predictions and misclassifications

* Use Grad-CAM or similar for feature map visualization

<b>6. Deployment</b>

* Build a REST API endpoint for inference (Flask or FastAPI)

* Prepare Dockerfile for containerized deployment

<b>7. Documentation</b>

* Write detailed README with setup, usage, and results

* Add code comments and docstrings

* Provide sample input/output examples

<b>8. Testing</b>

* Write unit and integration tests

* Test with custom images outside the MNIST dataset
